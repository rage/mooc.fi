The University of Helsinki may also use external controllers to process personal data, such as companies offering system services, which can process personal data on behalf of the University of Helsinki based on a commission agreement.

The University of Helsinki may release necessary personal data on students to the following recipients via the national university data pool or directly:

### 8. Transferring data outside the EU or EEA

It is the university’s data-protection policy to be especially careful if personal data is to be transferred outside the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries that do not offer the same data protection as the EU’s GDPR.

Personal data is transferred outside the EU and EEA in accordance with the requirements of the data-protection regulations. The course servers may be located on the servers of international companies (at present, Google) within the EU and EEA. In such cases, the MOOC Center will draw up separate agreements on processing of personal data with the service provider.

### 9. Principles for protection of the register

The MOOC.fi system is protected with a combination of username/password and in accordance with data-protection principles in general use at the University of Helsinki.

Personal data are encrypted when transferred over the network. Only people appointed to the task have access to the user register. These persons are bound to confidentiality.

### 10. Storage period for personal data or criteria for storage period

The controller can remove identifying data as needed, or users can ask to have their personal data removed from the register, but the data is not removed automatically

Student data is retained in accordance with the scheme of the document administration at the University of Helsinki. Personal data are primarily stored for the period of time required for the implementation of the course, but there are also long-term course modules, where the data are retained for a longer time.

### 11. Information on the existence of automatic decision-making or profiling, as well as on the logic of processing and its significance for the registered student

The automatic assessment of assignments (automatic decision-making) is a necessary feature for the service offered (courses based on automatic feedback). The correctness of a programming assignment, for example, will be assessed automatically based on whether the student’s program passes the automatic tests that a teacher has set. If there is a fault in the automatic assessment, you can ask for it to be corrected primarily by contacting the teacher of the course or the address mooc@cs.helsinki.fi.

Users are not profiled according to personal qualities.
