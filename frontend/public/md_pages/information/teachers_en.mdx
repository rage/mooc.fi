# For the teacher

*Create your own online course easily and quickly*

The MOOC Centreâ€™s online learning management system is suitable as a platform for all open online courses. Courses that are of particular interest to large groups of learners benefit from the automation features of the learning environment: many things from the assessment of answers to the transfer of credits to the University of Helsinki study register can be handled automatically. The learning environment has also been built in such a way that the studies carried out in the courses can easily be done.

We also offer a versatile online learning environment for the educational needs of other educational institutions. We are happy to discuss this with you in more detail.

If you are interested in utilizing the course contents of the University of Helsinki, for example, to perform programming exercises in your own teaching at the second level, you can learn more about this possibility here: [https://www.mooc.fi/teacher-guide/](/en/teacher-guide)

Contact [Mika Tompuri](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/about-us/people/people-finder/mika-tompuri-9411181) regarding the collaboration or if you want to create your own MOOC on the platform.
