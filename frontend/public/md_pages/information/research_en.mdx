The MOOC Centre of the University of Helsinki’s learning management system (MOOC.fi) is an excellent example of what long-term co-creation can achieve. The MOOC learning environment began to be built by professors, teachers, researchers and students of the Department of Computer Science when it was identified the need to open the teaching of computer science free of charge to everyone, not just students of the University of Helsinki, and to raise the level of national programming competence. Other solutions were unable to meet the ambitious goals of offering completely free, even radically open, and high-quality self-study programming opportunities to the widest possible range. The long-term development work resulted in an easy-to-use and intuitive MOOC online learning platform, which is actively used by a huge number of students at the University of Helsinki as well as continuous learners worldwide.

We have conducted long-term scientific research related to the various components of the online learning environment and the courses offered through the environment, which has produced dozens of scientific publications over the past decade. Research on online education at the MOOC Centre continues to be active.

The MOOC Centre is constantly looking for opportunities to collaborate in research with researchers, teachers, and students in the graduate phase. We are interested in both basic learning research and bold and forward-looking topics such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.
