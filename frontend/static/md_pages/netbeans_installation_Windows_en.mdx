**NB! The latest Java 8 development environment (8u231) might cause _Malformed argument has embedded quote_ exception when building or 
running projects**

To prevent this issue, install an older version of the development environment (8u221 or older).

If you want to use the latest development environment, append 

> `-J-Djdk.lang.Process.allowAmbiguousCommands=true`
 
to the **default_options** in **tmcbeans/etc/tmcbeans.conf** (you can find it from the folder where you have installed NetBeans with TMC).

### 1. Installing Java



Download the Java 8 development environment (Java SE Development Kit 8u161) from 
[https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jdk8-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jdk8-downloads.html).

It is likely you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, so download 
**jdk-8u161-windows-x64.exe**. 
_(If the available number is bigger than 161, you may download it as well)._

Once you've downloaded the file, install it on your computer.

You will have to create yourself an Oracle-account. 
The registration asks for all kinds of things, and for every field you do not know what to enter (for example the name of your company),
you can just enter "Lolled corporation Ltd" or something similiar. 

---

**If you have other versions of Java installed, they may prevent the development environment from working properly.**
Remove all other Java versions. 
Especially versions 9, 10 and 11 have proven problematic.
