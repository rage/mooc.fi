**NB! The latest Java 8 development environment (8u231) might cause _Malformed argument has embedded quote_ exception when building or 
running projects**

To prevent this issue, install an older version of the development environment (8u221 or older).

If you want to use the latest development environment, append 

> `-J-Djdk.lang.Process.allowAmbiguousCommands=true`
 
to the **default_options** in **tmcbeans/etc/tmcbeans.conf** (you can find it from the folder where you have installed NetBeans with TMC).

### 1. Installing Java

Get Java 8 development environment (Java SE Development Kit 8u221) from
[https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jdk8-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jdk8-downloads.html).

Download file **jdk-8u221-macosx-x64.dmg**
_(Versions older than 8u221 should work just fine as well)_

Once you have downloaded the file, install the development environment to your computer. 

---

You will have to create yourself an Oracle-account. 
The registration asks for all kinds of things, and for every field you do not know what to enter (for example the name of your company),
you can just enter "Lolled corporation Ltd" or something similiar. 

---

**If you have other versions of Java installed, they may prevent the development environment from working properly.**
Remove all other Java versions. 
Especially versions 9, 10 and 11 have proven problematic.

###  2. Installing NetBeans with TMC

Download the file from [http://update.testmycode.net/installers/tmc-netbeans_org_mooc/tmc-netbeans_org_mooc_tmcbeans-macosx.tgz](http://update.testmycode.net/installers/tmc-netbeans_org_mooc/tmc-netbeans_org_mooc_tmcbeans-macosx.tgz).

When the download is complete, install the program to your computer. 

**If the installation program does not open** try opening it by right clicking it and selecting 'Open'.
