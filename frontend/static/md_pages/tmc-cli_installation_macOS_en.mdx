Follow the instructions below to install the Test My Code client

Note: this software has not been tested on a macOS device (yet), so some functionalities might not work.

### Install using the install script<a name="using-script"></a>

`cd` into the directory where you want to download tmc-cli-rust and run the following command:

64 bit MacOS:

> `curl -0 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rage/tmc-cli-rust/dev/scripts/install.sh | bash -s x86_64 mac`
        
32 bit MacOS:
    
> `curl -0 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rage/tmc-cli-rust/dev/scripts/install.sh | bash -s i686 mac`

### Install manually<a name="manual-installation"></a>

If using the installer is not an option for you, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/rage/tmc-cli-rust/releases/latest) manually.

After downloading 'tmc-cli-rust', navigate to the directory it's located in and make it an executable with the command

> `chmod u+x ./tmc-cli-rust`

To use the software from any directory, you can add it to your environmental variables with the following command (substituting DIRECTORY for the location where tmc-cli-rust resides at.)

> `echo "alias tmc='DIRECTORY/tmc-cli-rust'" >> "$HOME/.bashrc"`

### Tab-completion from commandline<a name="tab-completion"></a>

If your shell is Bash, you can generate shell completion scripts by running the following commands:

Create the completions directory if it doesn't exist

> `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/tmc-autocomplete`

Generate the completions script to the directory

> `tmc generate-completions --bash > ~/.local/share/tmc-autocomplete/tmc.bash`

Add the file to your bash configuration so that bash knows where to look for the completions

> `echo "source ~/.local/share/tmc-autocomplete/tmc.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`

For Zsh, run these commands:

> `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/tmc-autocomplete`

Generate the completions script to the directory

> `tmc generate-completions --zsh > ~/.local/share/tmc-autocomplete/_tmc`

Add the file to your zsh configuration:

> `echo "fpath(~/.local/share/tmc-autocomplete/_tmc " '$fpath)' >> "~/.zshrc"`

> `echo "compdef _tmc tmc" >> ".zshrc"`

Make sure to have the appropriate software configuration for completions to work. For Bash, this might be `bash-completion`. For Zsh, consider `zsh-completions`.

### Getting started <a name="getting-started"></a>

#### Commands

> `tmc [FLAGS] [SUBCOMMAND]`

FLAG | Description
:--- | :---
`-h, --help` | Prints help information
`-d, --no-update` | Disable auto update temporarily
`-V, --version` | Prints version information

#### Logging in

You can log in using `tmc login`. This saves your TMC login information to a configuration file in `<linux config path>` - you will only have to log in once.


The application will ask you to select an organization afterwards.

#### Logging out

You can log out using 'tmc logout'. This will remove your login token from the configuration file.

> `~ $ tmc logout`

#### Listing courses

Once you have logged in, you can list all the available courses on the server with

> `~ $ tmc courses`

#### Downloading course exercises

Either
- Navigate to a suitable directory in which you wish to download your exercises. Then, run 

> `tmc download [COURSE_NAME] .` 

- Enter suitable filepath as an argument 

> `tmc download [COURSE_NAME] [FILEPATH]`

This will download all available exercises into it.

#### Running tests

After you've completed an exercise and wish to run tests on it, navigate to the exercise directory and run `tmc test`. If you are in the course root directory, you can also give the name of the exercise as argument: `tmc test exercise1`.

> `~/tmc-courses/test-course/exercise1 $ tmc test`

#### Listing exercises

If you want to see your current progress, you can view the status of all course exercises with `tmc exercises [course]`.

> `~/tmc-courses/test-course/ $ tmc exercises test-course`
