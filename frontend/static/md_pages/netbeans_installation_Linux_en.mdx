### 1. Installing Java 

We recommend installing the OpenJDK package for linux. 
Execute the following command in terminal:

> `sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk`

If you have other versions of Java installed, they may precend the IDE from working properly. 
We recommend removing all other Java versions. 
Especially Java versions 9, 10 and 11 have proven problematic. 

Change the active version of Java with the command: 

> `sudo update-alternatives --config java`

Select the option number with Java 8, for example on my computer this is "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java", and press enter. 

Next install OpenJFX, which we use to create graphical user interfaces. 
Use the command: 

> `sudo apt-get install openjfx`
