<SectionBox>

### Install using Flatpak<a name="using-flatpak"></a>

> `flatpak install flathub fi.mooc.tmc.tmc-cli-rust`

Create alias after installation for ease of use with:

> `echo "alias tmc=\"flatpak run fi.mooc.tmc.tmc-cli-rust\"" >> ~/.bashrc`

After restarting the terminal, this should work:

> `tmc --help`

`cd` into the directory where you want to download tmc-cli and run the following command:

64 bit Linux:

> `curl -0 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rage/tmc-cli-rust/dev/scripts/install.sh | bash -s x86_64 linux`

### Install manually<a name="manual-installation"></a>

If using the installers is not an option for you, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/rage/tmc-cli-rust/releases/latest) manually.

After downloading 'tmc-cli-rust', navigate to the directory it's located in and make it an executable with the command

> `chmod u+x ./tmc-cli-rust`

To use the software from any directory, you can add it to your environmental variables with the following command (substituting DIRECTORY for the location where tmc-cli-rust resides at.)

> `echo "alias tmc='DIRECTORY/tmc-cli-rust'" >> "$HOME/.bashrc"`

### Getting started <a name="getting-started"></a>

#### Commands

> `tmc [FLAGS] [SUBCOMMAND]`

FLAG | Description
:--- | :---
`-h, --help` | Prints help information
`-d, --no-update` | Disable auto update temporarily
`-V, --version` | Prints version information

#### Logging in

You can log in using `tmc login`. This saves your TMC login information to a configuration file in `<linux config path>` - you will only have to log in once.


The application will ask you to select an organization afterwards.

#### Logging out

You can log out using 'tmc logout'. This will remove your login token from the configuration file.

> `~ $ tmc logout`

#### Listing courses

Once you have logged in, you can list all the available courses on the server with

> `~ $ tmc courses`

#### Downloading course exercises

Either
- Navigate to a suitable directory in which you wish to download your exercises. Then, run 

> `tmc download [COURSE_NAME] .` 

- Enter suitable filepath as an argument 

> `tmc download [COURSE_NAME] [FILEPATH]`

This will download all available exercises into it.

#### Running tests

After you've completed an exercise and wish to run tests on it, navigate to the exercise directory and run `tmc-cli-rust test`. If you are in the course root directory, you can also give the name of the exercise as argument: `tmc-cli-rust test exercise1`.

> `~/tmc-courses/test-course/exercise1 $ tmc test`

#### Listing exercises

If you want to see your current progress, you can view the status of all course exercises with `tmc exercises [course]`.

> `~/tmc-courses/test-course/ $ tmc exercises test-course`
