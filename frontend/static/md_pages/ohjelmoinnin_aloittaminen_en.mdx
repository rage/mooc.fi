## Starting to code <a name="ohjelmoinnin-aloittaminen"></a>

After you have installed Java and TMC to your computer, the next steps are to create a **MOOC.fi account** and start coding. 
MOOC.fi account is required, so that we can keep track of the exercises you have completed. 

### Create MOOC.fi account <a name="mooc.fi-tunnuksen-luominen"></a>

Create yourself a MOOC.fi account in the course material. 

### Log in to the development environment <a name="kirjautuminen-ohjelmointiympäristöön"></a>

Start the TMCBeans development environment you installed. 

When the environment starts, it asks for your e-mail address and password. 

Use the details of your MOOC.fi account you created in the previous step.

### Select your organization <a name="organisaation-valinta"></a>

The development environment asks the organization you do the exercises for. 

Select the organization mentioned in the course material. 


For example the organization for "Programming MOOC 2020" the organization is "MOOC".

### Select your course <a name="kurssin-valinta"></a>

Now select your course. The courses you see listed here debend on your organization.

<img src="/static/images/installation/linux-tmcbeans-select-course.png"
alt="Kurssin valinta TMC NetBeansissa"
width="100%" height="100%"/>

A TMC settings window will open. 
The default settings should be ok for completing your course. 

</SectionBox>

### Doing your first coding exercise <a name="ensimmäisen-tehtävän-tekeminen"></a>

Next we will go through step by step how you can complete the first exercise of 
"Programming MOOC 2020". 
Even if you are doing another course, read the instructions to the end because they contain important
information about the development environment. 

</SectionBox>

#### Download the exercises

After you have logged in to the development environment and selected your organization and course, TMC will suggest exercises you can download (if there are any available).
Download the exercises you want -- the exercises have to do with the course material of the course you have selected.

Now you should have the exercises downloaded to the development environment. 

You can see the exercises listed on the left. 
Select the __Projects-tab__, and a small circles indicating completed exercises appear.

#### Do an exercise

Open exercise Part01_01.AdaLovelace.

Double click the exercise, and look for a source code file called AdaLovelace.java.
Currently all source code files can be found from __"Source Packages"__ directory in the exercise template.

You can open the exercise to the editor view by double clicking the file AdaLovelace.java.
The editor view is the text editor at the middle of the TMC window, where you can make changes to the source code of a program.

Modify the source code so, that you see the following on your editor:

```java

    public class AdaLovelace {
        public static void main(String[]args){
            System.out.println("Ada Lovelace :D");
        }
    }

```
</SectionBox>

<SectionBox>

### Running the source code <a name="lähdekoodin-ajaminen"></a>

You can run the source code by clicking the __Run__ button on TMC.

<img src="/static/images/installation/linux-tmcbeans-toolbar-run.png"
alt="Ohjelman ajaminen TMC NetBeansissa"
width="100%" height="100%"/>

If you modified the AdaLovelace.java file as instructed, the program output should be: 


> `Ava Lovelace :D`

You can modify the source code again and run the program as many times as you want. 

</SectionBox>

<SectionBox>

### Testing the source code <a name="lähdekoodin-testaaminen"></a>

Exercises often have automatic tests, which give you feedback on your solution. 

You can run the tests by clicking the __Test__ button on TMC.

<img src="/static/images/installation/linux-tmcbeans-toolbar-test.png"
alt="Ohjelman testaaminen TMC NetBeansissa"
width="100%" height="100%"/>

When you run the tests of the AdaLovelace exercise we worked on, the tests should give you a warning message. 
By reading the warning message, we find out the output was not correct.
The output should have been "Ada Lovelace."

By modifying the souce code like so, we get the correct output. 

```java
    public class AdaLovelace {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Ada Lovelace");
        }
    }
```

Run the tests again.

Now all the tests should pass, and TMC should ask if you want to send your solution to the server. 

</SectionBox>

<SectionBox>

### Sending your solution to the server <a name="tehtävän-lähettäminen-palvelimelle"></a>

Sending your solution to the server means submitting your exercise for grading. 
The exercises are almos always graded automatically, so you get your points (or a warning message) fast. 

You can submit your solution either after all tests have passed, or separately by clicking the submit button on TMC. 
.

<img src="/static/images/installation/linux-tmcbeans-toolbar-submit.png"
alt="Tehtävän lähettäminen palvelimelle TMC NetBeansissa"
width="100%" height="100%"/>

After you have submitted your solution to the server and its tests have passed on the server, you receive your exercise points and sometimes a short survey. 
Please do respond to the surveys, we use the responses to develop out courses.

### Checking your points <a name="pistetilanteen-tarkistaminen"></a>

You can check your points by logging in to [tmc.mooc.fi](https://tmc.mooc.fi). Use your MOOC.fi account to log in to the service.
