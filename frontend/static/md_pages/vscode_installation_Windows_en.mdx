Follow the instructions below to download Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and TestMyCode (TMC) extension for VSCode. To function correctly, TestMyCode extension requires Java Runtime Environment.

If you are using a computer provided by the computer science department you can skip directly to [Installing TestMyCode extension](#TestMyCode-asentaminen) section.

###  Installing Visual Studio Code <a name="VSCoden-asentaminen"></a>

Please install Visual Studio Code from the link below. Visual Studio Code is not the same program as Microsoft Visual Studio.  

1. Download the installation file from [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Once download is completed, double-click the file to open it.
3. Follow the instructions of the installation file.

### Installing Java <a name="javan-asentaminen"></a>

**NB!**
TMC extension will download Java Runtime Environment for itself if you don't have Java installed. 
We suggest that you install Java before continuing with the TMC extension installation. 
If you have Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer, you can skip this part.

1. Download AdoptOpenJDK11, open development and runtime environment for Java 11, from [https://adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot).

2. Select OpenJDK 11 (LTS) and HotSpot. Then click "Latest release" to download Java.

**NB!** When installing Java with the installation file you just downloaded, in the Custom Setup phase set both "Set JAVA_HOME variable" and "JavaSoft (Oracle) registry keys" to "Entire feature will be installed on local hard drive" (see the images below).

### Installing Python <a name="python-asentaminen"></a>

1. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest version of Python 3.
3. Double-click the installation file to start the installation. 
4. Make sure you choose "Add Python 3.x to PATH" (see picture point 1).
5. Choose "Install now" (see picture point 2).
6. Once installation is completed, you can close the install window.

### Installing TestMyCode extension for VSCode <a name="TestMyCode-asentaminen"></a>

1. Open Visual Studio Code.  
2. At the right you can see icons, choose the Extension view (see picture point 1).  
3. Type **TestMyCode** in the search field (see picture point 2).  
4. Press "Install" (see picture point 3).

## Starting programming <a name="ohjelmoinnin-aloittaminen"></a>
When you have downloaded VSCode and TestMyCode extension, next step is to make a **Mooc.fi-account**. The account is made so we can track your points on the course. After that you can start programming.

### Making a MOOC.fi-account <a name="mooc.fi-tunnuksen-luominen"></a>
Go to course material and make a MOOC-fi account.

### Logging into programming environment <a name="kirjautuminen-ohjelmointiympäristöön"></a>

Start TestMyCode extension by clicking TMC icon in the left bar.

Log in by clicking "Log in" button.

Use the account you made in previous step.

width="100%" height="100%"/>

### Choosing an organization <a name="organisaation-valinta"></a>
When you log in, you will se a list of courses selected (at start it is empty).
You can add courses to the list by clicking **Add new course** button.

By clicking **Add new course** the extension will show all possible organizations that offer courses.
Select the organization that is mentioned in your course material.

For example on the course "Ohjelmoinnin MOOC 2020" the organization is "MOOC".

<img src="/static/images/installation/vscode/select-org.png"
alt="Organisaation valinta"
width="100%" height="100%"/>

### Selecting the course <a name="kurssin-valinta"></a>

After this, select the correct course. This is mentioned in your course material.

### Completing your first programming exercise <a name="ensimmäisen-tehtävän-tekeminen"></a>

Lets go through an example where you can complete the 2nd exercise on the course "mooc-java-programming-i".
Even if you have completed exercises on some other course, read the instructions to the end. It will have important information on the programming environment.

#### Downloading exercises

When you have logged in and selected the course. Click the course "mooc-java-programming-i" in "My Courses"-view.
Download exercises you want to complete(at minimum part01-Part01_02.AdaLovelace). Instructions to these exercises will be in your course material.

Now exercises are downloaded.
Click "Open exercise workspace".
<img src="/static/images/installation/vscode/open_exercise_workspace.png"
alt="Organisaation valinta"
width="100%" height="100%"/>

#### Working on your programming exercises

Open exercises by clicking Explorer button in the left corner.
Open exercise "part01-Part01_02.AdaLovelace"
<img src="/static/images/installation/vscode/click_exercises.png"
alt="Organisaation valinta"
width="100%" height="100%"/>

Find a source code file called "AdaLovelace.java".
Source code files are located in directory __"src"__.

You can open editor by clicking the exercise.
Editor is the view on the middle. You can type there to make changes to the source code.

Make the following changes to the source code: 
```java

    public class AdaLovelace {
        public static void main(String[]args){
            System.out.println("Ada Lovelace :D");
        }
    }

```

### Running the source code <a name="lähdekoodin-ajaminen"></a>

To run the source code, you need an additional extension on VSCode. Download one. Your course material will have help on this part.
For Java there is "Java Test Runner" for example.

If you modified the file as instructed previously, the program should print following:

> `Ada Lovelace :D`

### Testing the source code <a name="lähdekoodin-testaaminen"></a>

There will be most of the time automated test for the exercises. These tests will give information on your progress on the exercise.
Test your solution by clicking "TMC- Run tests" in the top right corner.

When you run tests on the source code we just wrote, tests should give you an error message.
By following the message, we see that our program printed something erroneous.
The print hould have been "Ada Lovelace".

The program will print "Ada Lovelace" when you modify the source code like the following:

```java
    public class AdaLovelace {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Ada Lovelace");
        }
    }
```

Run the tests again. This time the test will pass and TMC will ask you if you want to submit your solution.

### Submitting the solution to TMC-server <a name="tehtävän-lähettäminen-palvelimelle"></a>

Sending the exercise to TMC-server means that your solution will be reviewed.
It will be almost always reviewed automatically. You will get points (or possible error message) really fast.

You can return the solution after running tests or from TMC-menu which is located in the top right corner.

When you have sent right solution the the server, you will be given points from the exercise. Also if you will be given a short survey, filling it is advised. We use the information to make our courses better.

### Checking your points <a name="pistetilanteen-tarkistaminen"></a>

You can check your points by logging in [tmc.mooc.fi](https://tmc.mooc.fi). Use the same user you made earlier.
